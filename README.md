# Tesla-News
A API based project for receiving and showing news data from Tesla company.

This API is a free api from newsapi.org and articles are from Tesla Company.
Unfortunatly it won't work on browsers because I'll need to use paid content.
Next page named news.html have full news of its database just click to "See More News" to get 9 by 9 news.

So you need to downlaod files and run project with live server in vs code OR XAMPP in systems.

fuly responsive and dynamic.
Later I'll update this project into better one (maybe with browser working)
